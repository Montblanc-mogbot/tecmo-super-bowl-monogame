  # The Bug
  bug_explanation: |
    In the original NES game, Player 1 has a significant advantage in 
    recovering onside kicks. This is because the ball travels one less 
    yard when kicked with an empty power bar for Player 1 compared to 
    Player 2.
  
  # Recovery data by team (sample from original)

      p2_recovery_hex: "09cc"

  # Recovery mechanics
  recovery_mechanics:
    - The kicking team must travel 10 yards before touching the ball
    - P1's shorter kick (9 yards) means their players are closer
    - This gives P1 ~1-2 yard head start in recovery race
    - P2 must kick 10 yards, giving receiving team advantage

  # For MonoGame Implementation
  fix_recommendation: |
    In the MonoGame reimplementation, ensure both players' kicks travel 
    the same distance for the same power level. The one-yard difference 
    should be removed for fair play.

  # Data format notes
  data_format:
    - "HEX values represent internal game calculations"
    - "AVG # of KICKS shows sample size"
    - "RECOVERED count per team"
    - "RATE shows recovery percentage"

notes:
  - "This bug was documented in BUGS_UNUSED_AND_HIDDEN_ITEMS.docx"
  - "P1 advantage is approximately 10-15% higher recovery rate"
  - "Bug affects all teams equally - not team-specific"
  - "Fix: Use same distance calculation for both players"
