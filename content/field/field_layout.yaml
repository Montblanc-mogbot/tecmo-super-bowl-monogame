# Field Layout Data
#
# Source: DOCS/FIELDLAYOUT.xlsx
# This data describes how the football field is constructed from tiles,
# including zoom-out points and subsection lookup tables.

id: field_layout

# Field is composed of tile sections that map to PPU nametable entries
# The original uses a complex system of pointers and lookup tables
# to render different zoom levels and field sections

# Field zoom out pointers
# Used when camera zooms out to show more of the field

  # Format: Each entry points to a tile section

# Notes for MonoGame Implementation
notes:
  - "Original uses complex pointer tables for tile lookup"
  - "Field is rendered using NES PPU nametable entries"
  - "For MonoGame: Consider using tilemap or pre-rendered field texture"
  - "Zoom levels can be implemented with camera scale transforms"
  - "Original has ~282KB of field layout data - very detailed"
  - "May want to simplify: use single high-res field texture with scrolling"
  - "Yard lines and numbers can be drawn procedurally"
  - "Field layout affects gameplay: boundaries, hash marks, etc."
