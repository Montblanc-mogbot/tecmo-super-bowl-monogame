  # For MonoGame Implementation
  monogame_notes: |
    The original NES uses pre-calculated animation tables for ball rolling.
    For MonoGame, consider:
    1. Using actual physics for ball movement
    2. Sprite animation based on velocity
    3. Rotation animation tied to distance traveled
    4. No need for pre-calculated tables - calculate in real-time

notes:
  - "Original uses lookup tables for performance on NES"
  - "Ball has multiple animation frames (spinning)"
  - "Animation tied to X/Y movement"
  - "For MonoGame: Can use physics + procedural animation"
