# Source: DOCS/defplaylistpointercode.xlsx
# Maps defensive formations/play IDs to player reaction assignments
# Each defensive play has 11 player slots (one per defender)

defensive_play_pointers:
  # Format: play_id -> [player1_reaction, player2_reaction, ..., player11_reaction]
  # Player positions: RE, NT, LE, ROLB, RILB, LILB, LOLB, RCB, LCB, FS, SS
