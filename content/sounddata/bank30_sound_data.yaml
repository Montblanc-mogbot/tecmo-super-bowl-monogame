# bank30: sound data scaffold
#
# This bank is a placeholder representation of additional song/SFX data tables.
# The goal is to mirror the original ROM structure (Bank29/30 hold a lot of
# audio tables) while sourcing all content from YAML.
#
# Notes:
# - pitch values are symbolic for now (e.g., C4, D#4, N1 for noise)
# - duration is in ticks (relative; tempo applies for songs)
